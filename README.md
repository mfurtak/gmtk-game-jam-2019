# Metro Gnome

An item juggling Gnome decides to go on adventure.

Can you make it through the challenges ahead with only one item equipped at a time? You'll need to keep track of time and juggle your item usage well to survive!

## Controls:
**Arrow keys** for movement
**Space bar** uses the currently active item
